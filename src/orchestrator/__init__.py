"""
Modular orchestrator package.

Implements: SPEC-12.01-12.07

This package provides the modular orchestrator architecture:
- core: Base RLM orchestration loop
- intelligent: Claude-powered decision making
- async_executor: Parallel and speculative execution
- checkpointing: Session persistence
- steering: User interaction support

All public classes are re-exported here for backward compatibility.
