"""
Epistemic verification module for hallucination detection.

Implements: SPEC-16 Epistemic Verification

This module provides consistency-based verification for Claude API,
detecting procedural hallucinations where the model "knows but doesn't use"
information correctly.

Example:
    >>> from src.epistemic import ClaimVerification, HallucinationReport
    >>> claim = ClaimVerification(
    ...     claim_id="c1",
    ...     claim_text="The file contains 5 functions",
    ...     evidence_support=0.9,
    ...     evidence_dependence=0.8,
    ... )
    >>> claim.combined_score
    0.8485281374238571
