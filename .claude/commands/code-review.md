Review the current changes following docs/process/code-review.md.

## Review Checklist

### Correctness
- Does the implementation match the spec section? (cite §X.Y)
- Are edge cases handled (empty context, max depth, timeout)?
- Do error states produce meaningful messages?

### Type Safety
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/rlm-claude-code && uv run ty check src/
```
- All public functions have return type annotations?
- No `# type: ignore` without justification?

### Testing
- Unit tests for new functions?
- Property tests for data transformations?
- Security tests for REPL operations?

### Performance
- Complexity classifier <50ms?
- REPL execution <100ms?
- No O(n²) on context size?

### Security
- No eval() on untrusted input?
- Subprocess calls use allowlist?
- API keys not logged?

### Style
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/rlm-claude-code
uv run ruff check src/
uv run ruff format src/ --check
```
